# diff-shades

The Black shade analyser and comparison tool.

AKA Richard's personal take at a better black-primer (by stealing ideas from
mypy-primer) :p

Basically runs Black over millions of lines of code from various open source
projects. Why? So any changes to Black can be gauged on their relative impact.

Features include:

- Simple but readable diffing capabilities
- Repeatable analyses via --repeat-projects-from
- Structured JSON output
- Per-project python_requires support
- Custom per-analysis formatting configuration
- Oh and of course, pretty output!

Potential tasks / additionals:

- jupyter notebook support
- even more helpful output
- better UX (particularly when things go wrong)
- code cleanup as my code is messy as usual :p

## Installation

**Pre-requisite**: Python 3.7 or higher

diff-shades is currently not available on any public index. This might change
later on, but for the time being you can install diff-shades via this command:

```
python -m pip install https://github.com/ichard26/diff-shades/archive/main.zip
```

## Usage

```

### Running an analysis

**Pre-requisite**: a pre-installed version of Black you want to analyze

Run the `analyze` command with an filepath to save the results to.

```console

```

To select which projects to run Black over you can use `-s` / `--select` and
`-e` / `--exclude`. As like with Black exclusions are calculated first with
inclusions second.

If you'd like to rerun an analysis with the same project setup there's the
`--repeat-projects-from` option available. It will check if any pre-existing
clones match the recorded commit, re-cloning if not. This is very useful to
compare formatting differences between two versions of Black as this will
ensure the same code was tested over.

Setting a cache directory for clones with `-w` / `--work-dir` is highly
recommended cloning can be rather slow. Don't worry about the cache going
stale, diff-shades will check that the clone is suitable before using it and
will replace it if necessary.

You can also pass custom Black arguments that'll get joined to the hard-coded
configuration in [`diff_shades/config.py`](./src/diff_shades/config.py). Just
pass `--` and then any valid arguments and you're good! The `--` is strongly
recommended since anything that comes after will be left unprocessed and won’t
be treated as options for diff-shades itself. Any unknown options will be
rejected but unsupported options will be silently ignored... except for the
file discovery options! Those will have an impact and are highly discouraged
since they'll be applied to all selected projects.

For very detailed logs on what exactly diff-shades is doing `--verbose` has you
covered.

### Comparing analyses

Run the `compare` command passing both analyses as arguments. To compare a
specific project also pass the project's name.

```console
ichard26@acer-ubuntu:~/programming/tools/diff-shades$ diff-shades compare same.json same.json
[18:43:00] Loaded first analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/same.json
[18:43:03] Loaded second analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/same.json

Nothing-changed.

ichard26@acer-ubuntu:~/programming/tools/diff-shades$ diff-shades compare analysis.json analysis-2.json
[18:45:08] Loaded first analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/analysis.json
           Loaded second analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/analysis-2.json

╭────────────────────── Summary ──────────────────────╮
│ 7 projects & 25 files changed / 30 changes [+0/-30] │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Differences found.
```

For extra details there's the mutually exclusive `--diff` and `--list` flags
(although `--list` is not implemented yet :p). They work great especially as CI
reports (perhaps w/ `--dump-html` too).

If you'd like a non-zero exit code if a difference was found please pass
`--check`.

### Showing an analysis

The `show` command is diff-shades's all purpose analysis viewer. It operates at
the analysis, project, file, or even file attribute level.

```console
ichard26@acer-ubuntu:~/programming/tools/diff-shades$ diff-shades show data.json
[22:53:43] Loaded analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/data.json

If you're using `show` as part of a larger script, then `-q` / `--quiet` may be
useful by suppressing non-essential output.

**Note**: show-ing a project is currently not implemented and so are `--diff` /
`--list` output modes.

### Showing an analysis (failures only!)

The `show-failed` command lists all failures (optionally narrowable to a single
project) in a compact format.

```console
ichard26@acer-ubuntu:~/programming/tools/diff-shades$ diff-shades show-failed failing.json
[22:46:04] Loaded analysis: /home/ichard26/programming/tools/diff-shades/failing.json

daylily:
  1. myfile: AssertionError - i feel like crashing today

# of failed files: 1
# of failed projects: 1
```

Asserting that the analysis is failure-free is incredibly simple with
`--check`.

### Appendix: tips!

diff-shades supports reading analyses stored as ZIP files as uncompressed
analysis files frequently hit the 100MB+ milestone. No special handing is
required, just pass a file with a `.zip` extension and diff-shades will
auto-extract it!

diff-shades also caches analysis file reads (saving the loaded objects as
pickles) to further improve responsiveness and overall performance. At most
five analyses will be cached at once. Cache entries which haven't been used in
the last 5 days will be dropped. If you're experiencing weird issues you can
clear the cache with the `--clear-cache` flag (before the command!).

If you're using diff-shades in CI, `--dump-html` might come in handy saving a
copy of all emitted output. Unfortunately it behaves poorly with progress bars
so don't use this w/ `analyze`. Additionally, `--no-color` and `--force-color`
exist to override rich's color support detection (say for GHA where colors are
supported but rich doesn't know that).

diff-shades also sees outside contributions whose contributors I greatly
appreciate. A list of all contributors can be found on the
[repo's insights page](https://github.com/ichard26/diff-shades/graphs/contributors).

Finally, this project wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for [black-primer]
which the legendary Cooper Lees (co-maintainer of psf/black) originally wrote.
Black-primer eventually spawned the creation of [mypy-primer], a black-primer
equivalent for mypy. Many features present in diff-shades come from
black-primer and mypy-primer.

## Changelog

### 21.12a6

- Don't forcefully set `--force-colors` if `--no-colors` was passed.
- Add `--quiet` to the compare command to suppress the unnecessary log
  messages.

### 21.12a5

- When running on GitHub Actions, `--force-colors` and the width will be
  forcefully set for you.

### 21.12a4

First public release, enjoy the alpha quality software :)
